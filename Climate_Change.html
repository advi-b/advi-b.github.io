                Causes of Climate Change

            </h2>

            <p>
                Water vapor, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and more greenhouse gases are causing the temperature on Earth to become hotter. This is called the Greenhouse Effect. All these gases cause heat to trap in the Earth and the temperatures to rise.
