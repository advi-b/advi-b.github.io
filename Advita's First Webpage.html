                I love my new bird named Snow. The reason we were going to get him was because my mom wanted an angel-like pretty white bird. When we asked the store manager if they had a white bird, they said that they only had one, but he was only two weeks old and not ready to be on sale yet. Since my mom really wanted to see him, the store manager said that this was not allowed, but she is still letting us see the cute baby bird. Going into a dark and extremely warm room, we see a bunch of tiny birds sitting next to each other sleeping. Out of all of them, there was one that shined bright out. Although he was white, if you looked at him a little more clearly, he was neon blue and lavender! We were allowed to take him and after that day, I have found a new best friend.
