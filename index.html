                Causes of Climate Change

            </h2>

            <p>
                Water vapor, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and more greenhouse gases are causing the temperature on Earth to become hotter. This is called the Greenhouse Effect. All these gases cause heat to trap in the Earth and the temperatures to rise.

                Effects of Climate Change
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are many dangerous effects of climate change. Here are a few effects that will make you want to rethink your choices. First of all, wildfires will burn up to eight times as much land by 2100. Next, 100% of reefs will be extinct by 2050. Another heart trembling effect is more droughts will make dry regions every more drier. Also, air pollution will increase which could become a major health hazard. Last but definitely not least, hunger will increase by 20 million by 2050.
